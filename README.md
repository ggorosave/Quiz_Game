# Vocabulary Quiz Game

## Description

Keeping students engaged in class or focused on their homework can be difficult sometimes. The Vocabulary Quiz Game is meant to be a fun way for students to engage with material they have learned while also allowing the instructor to gauage their students' progress. For this project, I used vanilla Javascript to develop a game that would present students with multiple choice questions, earn points for correct answers, and see their initals on a score board. While this project currently presents only a small handful of vocabulary to the user and uses local storage to store data, I hope to expand it one day to allow users to input their own questions and answers and have the score data persist in future versions.

Since this project aligns so well with my future career goals, I am open to collaboration to improve what I've already build.

## Credits

The [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) helped greatly while I worked on this project.

I also considered the functionality of the quizzes on 
[Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) as inspiration while I worked on this project, but no code was taken from their website.
