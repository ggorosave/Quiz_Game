# Vocabulary Quiz Game

## Description

Although this project is the fourth challenge from the U of A coding bootcamp and that is the primary reason I made it, I'm interested in developing education based applications and websites. With that in mind, I put extra effort in to making this application look nice and function well--though it could probably still use some improvements. 

This challenge was difficult for me because there were a lot of parts to keep track of, and it really made me think of better ways to organize and keep track of whats happening in my code. Going forward, I hope to follow a more structured process so that and can organize and track my code better.

Furthermore, I continue to learn a great deal about JavaScript and how to use it to facilitate the functionality of my website. Through the process of writing this code, I've developed a firmer understanding of DOM traversal, event listeners, time intervals, and I've even further expanded my understanding of the versatility of objects and arrays. Going forward, I hope to learn ways to simplify conditonal statements in my code. 

**NOTE:** Though acceptance critera for this project asked for a quiz about coding, I chose to make my quiz about vocabulary as I was a language and writing teacher for nearly fourteen years.

## Credits

The [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) helped greatly while I worked on this project.

I also considered the functionality of the quizzes on 
[Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) as inspiration while I worked on this project, but no code was taken from their website.
